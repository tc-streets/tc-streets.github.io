WILL BE BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY DUE TO HEAVY SNOW AND BLOWING SNOW... .A Winter Storm Warning has been issued for portions of southwest, south central, and east central Minnesota, and all of west central Wisconsin starting late Tuesday afternoon, and continuing through Wednesday morning. The warning includes areas along the Buffalo Ridge in west central Minnesota, and areas southeast of a line from Redwood Falls, to Hutchinson, Clearwater, Princeton and Rush City in Minnesota. Snowfall totals of 6 or more inches are likely in the warned area, with locally higher amounts possible. In addition, gusty northeast winds Tuesday night will shift to the northwest Wednesday, resulting in areas of blowing snow. Travel could be significantly impacted through at least Wednesday morning. Due to some uncertainties in the snowfall amounts, a Winter Storm Watch remains in effect Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday morning north of the Minnesota River from Granite Falls to St. Cloud and Milaca. Snowfall totals of 6 or more inches are still possible in the watch area. Snow will develop across southern Minnesota late Tuesday afternoon and spread northeastward across southern, and east central Minnesota, and into west central Wisconsin Tuesday night. The snow will be heavy at times. Snow will end from west to east Wednesday morning, but blowing snow could continue into the afternoon. ...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT FROM 9 PM TUESDAY TO NOON CST WEDNESDAY... * WHAT...Heavy snow expected.
