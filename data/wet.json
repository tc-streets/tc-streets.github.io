through Saturday morning north of a line from Canby, Minnesota, to Red Wing, Minnesota; and from Friday evening through Sunday morning north of a line from Morris, Minnesota, to Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Snow, rain, and freezing rain will develop Friday afternoon before transitioning to mostly snow Friday night. Temperatures will warm Saturday, allowing the snow to turn to a mix of rain and snow or all rain south of Morris to Eau Claire. This transition should allow conditions to improve quickly. North of that line, it appears snow will be the likely precipitation type from Friday night through Sunday morning. Significant amounts of snow could accumulate in these areas, possibly over a foot. Gusty east winds Friday night and early Saturday may produce some patchy blowing snow as well. ...WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING... * WHAT...Heavy wet snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 6 inches possible. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph. * WHERE...Portions of west central Wisconsin and central, east central and west central Minnesota. * WHEN...From Friday evening through Saturday morning. * IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility. * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There is low confidence regarding precipitation type during parts of this storm.
