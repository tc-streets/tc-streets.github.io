MORNING INTO EARLY AFTERNOON... Areas of mixed precipitation, mostly in the form of freezing drizzle, will develop mid to late morning Thursday and persist into the mid afternoon before turning to drizzle or ending. Temperatures will be below freezing as the precipitation begins, but could slowly rise above freezing during the afternoon. The tail end of the morning commute may be impacted. Conditions should improve by the evening commute with precipitation ending and temperatures a degree or two above freezing. Ice accumulation will be light, less than a tenth of an inch. However, any amount of ice can create very hazardous conditions. The patchy nature of this precipitation could leave some icy spots on roads, bridges, and sidewalks, with other areas remaining dry.
