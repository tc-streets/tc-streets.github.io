WINTER STORM LIKELY THIS WEEKEND... .A Winter Storm Watch remains in effect from Friday evening through Saturday morning north of a line from Canby, Minnesota, to Red Wing, Minnesota; and from Friday evening through Sunday morning north of a line from Morris, Minnesota, to Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Snow, rain, and freezing drizzle will develop late Friday afternoon before transitioning to mostly snow Friday night. Temperatures will warm Saturday, allowing the snow to turn to a mix of rain and snow or to all rain south of Morris to Eau Claire. This transition should allow conditions to improve quickly, following a few inches of accumulation. The rain will turn back to snow Saturday night and Sunday with additional accumulating snow. North of that line, it appears snow will be the likely precipitation type from Friday night through Sunday morning, although periods of freezing rain are also possible. Significant amounts of snow could accumulate in these areas, possibly over a foot. Some light ice accumulation is also possible. Gusty east winds Friday night and early Saturday may produce some patchy blowing snow as well. Meanwhile, areas of freezing drizzle will develop tonight and Friday. A light glazing of ice could lead to slick roads and difficult travel. A Winter Weather Advisory is in effect across southwest Minnesota from late tonight through Friday morning. ...WINTER STORM WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FROM FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING... * WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 5 inches and ice accumulations of a light glaze possible.
