This watch includes those counties located along and north of a Windom-Owatonna line, and south of an Ortonville-Scandia line. Thunderstorms capable of excessive rainfall are expected to begin tonight across western Minnesota, and spread across the rest of the watch area during the overnight hours. The heaviest rainfall is expected to fall during the overnight hours, but additional storms redeveloping Thursday afternoon will only exacerbate any flooding issues. Widespread rainfall amounts of 2 to 3 inches are expected by Friday evening across the watch area, with localized amounts of 3 to 5 inches possible in areas where the most stationary bands of thunderstorms set up. Recent heavy rainfall has led to very moist soil conditions and elevated streams and creeks across much of central and southern Minnesota. The combination of high rainfall rates and wet soil conditions could lead to rapid runoff and areas of flash flooding. ...FLASH FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT FROM 1 AM CDT THURSDAY THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING...
