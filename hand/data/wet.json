A Winter Storm Warning is now in effect for much of southern and central Minnesota, including the Twin Cities metro area. A Winter Weather Advisory remains in effect for portions of south central Minnesota, and West Central Wisconsin. An initial band of snow, heavy at times, will gradually shift northward through southern Minnesota, and into central Minnesota, as well as portions of west central Wisconsin this afternoon. Locally 3 to 6 inches of snow will fall before tapering off some in the late afternoon and early evening. However, more snow, heavy at times, will redevelop across Minnesota, and into west central Wisconsin later this evening, and overnight. Based on snowfall totals increasing from Fairmont, northeast to the Twin Cities and portions of west central Wisconsin, the Winter Weather Advisory has been upgraded to a Winter Storm Warning. The new Winter Storm Warning is west of a line from Fairmont to Faribault to Hastings in Minnesota, to Prescott, to Rice Lake in Wisconsin. Slowly, the band of heavy snow this afternoon will reach western and central Minnesota by late this afternoon. There could be a brief period late this afternoon, and into the evening where snowfall intensity is less, but redevelopment of heavy snow is likely later this evening, and into the overnight hours across most of southern Minnesota, with the exception along the Iowa border where more sleet and rain will become mixed in. Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour will be possible at times, especially this afternoon. Periods of mixed precipitation in the form of rain, snow, and sleet are expected along and south of a line from Redwood Falls, to the Saint Cloud, to Ladysmith, Wisconsin starting Thursday morning as much warmer air surges northward. Winds will increase tonight with gusts of 45 to 55 mph by Thursday. This will produce areas of blowing snow over much of central and southern Minnesota into western Wisconsin. Blizzard conditions are likely across west central Minnesota. Travel could become nearly impossible in this area by Thursday. ...WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 10 AM CDT FRIDAY... * WHAT...Snow, heavy at times, becoming mixed with sleet and snow Thursday morning. Snow accumulations of 8 to 14 inches and ice accumulations of up to one tenth of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph. * WHERE...Portions of northwest and west central Wisconsin and east central Minnesota. * WHEN...Until 10 AM CDT Friday. * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Travel could be very difficult.
