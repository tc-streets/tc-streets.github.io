A Winter Storm Watch is in effect for most of the rest of central and southern Minnesota and western Wisconsin. A potentially historic winter storm is expected starting Wednesday evening lasting into early Friday morning. Confidence is high that a band of heavy snow will reach central and western Minnesota Wednesday evening and continue through Thursday, tapering off in intensity gradually Thursday night. Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour will be possible at times. Periods of mixed precipitation in the form of rain, snow, and sleet are expected along and south of a line from New Ulm, to the Twin Cities metro, to Rice Lake, Wisconsin. There is still considerable uncertainty where this transition zone will set up. A tighter gradient in snowfall totals than currently forecast should be expected along this zone. Winds will increase Wednesday night with gusts of 45 to 55 mph by Thursday. This will lead to widespread blowing and drifting snow and blizzard conditions across west central Minnesota. Travel could become nearly impossible in this area by Thursday. ...WINTER STORM WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FROM WEDNESDAY EVENING THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING... * WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation possible.
